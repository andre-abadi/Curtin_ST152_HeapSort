A simple Java program designed to teach
the author how a programming heap works.
This heap uses a subclass HeapEntry to 
store an Object and an integer, which 
is interpreted as its priority where a 
larger number is better.

The heap program is designed to have 
HeapEntries added, which will be 
automatically sorted into the correct 
position. The heap can also have its 
highest priority item removed, causing 
it to rebalance itself after the removal.

The heap is also able to accept an 
array of HeapEntry objects with no order 
and order them by priority, then pasting
them back (in-order) back into the 
supplied array; an in-place heap-sort.
